						<h3>What We Do</h3>
						<p>YouthComputing is a non-profit organization committed to sparking a feeling of awe, action,
							and support in youth by connecting them with the tech world. We want to bring emerging
							technologies to youth and ensure that they feel supported when working in the tech world. We
							also want to ensure that youth are updated with industry level knowledge and are able to
							apply their skills outside of a classroom.
						</p>

						<h3>Why We Do It</h3>
						<p>We’re crazy enough to think we can change the world. Crazy because we’re just a bunch of
							friends trying to solve a problem we used to have. Crazy because we’ve been diagnosed with a
							love of learning. Crazy because we fit a 100 people in a venue that fits only 50 while
							keeping all of our events free. The dreamers. The believers. The doers. Join us.
